Here we are referring to your Brand Logo and Brand Name. You should have a name and a brand color that resonates with your products/services or your ideology. It is important to clearly define Brand Guidelines, that specify the exact color code of your logo, its exact size, and then you need to make sure that it is consistent on all the communication channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get you started, here is what different colors mean from the branding perspective:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Blue:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Most used colors in the popular Brand Logo&rsquo;s since it represents qualities like calm, trustworthy, reliable and a sense of security.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Red:&nbsp;</strong>Red is the most eye-catching color. It represents passion, strength and love. It is especially relevant for the brands dealing with food/fast-food.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Green:</strong>&nbsp;Associated with travel, agriculture and harmony, green signifies nature, adventure, outdoors, health, fertility, safety, and harmony.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Gold:</strong>&nbsp;Stands for prestige, power, wisdom and quality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Purple:</strong> Brands use this color to represent sophistication. It combines the qualities of red and blue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Yellow:</strong>&nbsp;Yellow is filled with joyous sunlight and inspires energy, enthusiasm, hope, cheer fulness&nbsp;etc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Orange:</strong>&nbsp;Orange is used by brands to make an expensive item appear less costly. It majorly represents youth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Brown:</strong>&nbsp;Brown represent dirt, earth and mountains that are reliable, solid&nbsp;and are connected to adventures. It is more preferred by men than women.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Black and White: </strong>In the world of brands, Black stands for elegance &amp; being elite, while White represents pureness and perfection.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you are still not sure which color to opt for, it is better to follow what other successful brands are doing.

For example, the startups targeting B2B customers can focus more on LinkedIn. While those with the B2C audience can target Facebook. Similarly, if you want to disseminate information, Quora is the best platform.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf your business is somehow related to the latest news and celebrities, Twitter can do wonders for you. Instagram and Pinterest are for the brands that want to showcase visually appealing images, like travel &amp; hospitality and food &amp; beverages.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo matter on which of these social media websites majority of your audience is present, your brand should have a presence on all the social media platforms. You can be more active on one than others, but having a company&rsquo;s page / account on each of them is an absolute necessity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the resources and time to post different content on different platforms, you can simply connect different social media accounts, so your post on Facebook gets automatically forwarded on Twitter / LinkedIn or other platforms as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Establish Communication with Your Target Audience</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.doorsstudio.com/admin/media/files/uploadimages/images/blog-1-3.jpg\" style=\"height:357px; width:746px\" /><br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou must have thought about your great startup idea and before planning to execute it, you must have thought about the people who would use your product / service.

You have to analyze the tactics and ideas used by the successful brands in promoting their businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Here are the digital marketing strategies that you can use to expand your business in 2019:</h3>\r\n\r\n<h2><br />\r\n1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)/Social Media Marketing (SMM)/Pay Per Click (PPC) :</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the range of activities that help in ranking the webpages on the first page of the search engines, especially Google. While social media marketing focuses on use of social media platforms to market product / services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They both are organic ways to increase website traffic. However, Pay-per-click gives you a temporary boost in traffic by displaying your product/service adds when user searches for specific keywords in the search engines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Google gives preference</strong> to pages where the amount of time spent on the page is more, since it thinks that user has found relevant information that it is looking for on that page. A combination of <a href=\"http://www.doorsstudio.com/blog/what-is-the-role-of-seo-in-internet-marketing\">SEO</a>,&nbsp;SMM and PPC can help you achieve this.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Some of the important tips to get the most of these are as follows:</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Use Infographics: Infographics gives a lot of information. It is wise to include attractive infographics on the landing pages of your PPC campaigns.</li>\r\n	<li>Better Navigation to reduce bounce rate: Give users information about related topics, so they remain on your website for longer.</li>\r\n	<li>Focus on YouTube SEO: Make you videos&rsquo; title, file name, and description SEO friendly. This will push your website onto the first page on Google and get you traffic from YouTube as well.</li>\r\n	<li>Make longer pages and longer video: Helps in keeping user engaged.</li>\r\n	<li>Focus on Topics, not keywords: Consider what your users are looking for rather than coming up with different ways that users can phrase a search query.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>2.&nbsp;Content Marketing :</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At present, content marketing is on peek because of one simple reason; it&rsquo;s what the customers want. Popup, banners and invasive ads are annoying; they are of no interest to the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People nowadays are more inclined towards quality content, something that is relevant and gives them value, and not something that will just clog their inboxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s really important to understand your customers&rsquo; needs and wants, rather than what you want them to buy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hubspot, Zappos, John Deere,</strong> and <strong>AARP</strong> are few names that have excelled the digital marketing game with their content marketing strategy. <strong>Hubspot is a million dollar company;</strong> it listens to the audiences first and then plans its content strategy accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has analyzed the issues / subjects / topics their visitors care about and is generating the in-depth blog posts about those issues. Besides this, it has adopted the following tactics to win the marketing game:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Added eBooks to their blog posts.</li>\r\n	<li>Used LinkedIn to send traffic to their Facebook videos.</li>\r\n	<li>Developed an educational and content sharing hub (Inbound.org) to promote its partnership programs and certifications.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOn the other hand, <strong>Zappos</strong>, a leading online shoe marketer, has set the standard in customer care. There is no reason to doubt their digital marketing success. Zappos provides 365-day money back assurance and also free shipping. Besides this, their policies are so appealing that they don&rsquo;t have to do much to market their online presence; their consumers happily sing their praises to one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>John Deere publication</strong> - The Furrow is one of the very old examples of content marketing. Itfocuses on the issues faced by their customers. It&rsquo;s been more than 120 years, the publication is still growing. The AARP has won many awards for their magazine&rsquo;s quality, design, and photography, yet there&#39;s nothing secretive about their success. All they do is, listen to their readers and use that information to settle on the topics which are most relevant to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Limit Self-Promotional Content :</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Companies often make the mistake of promoting themselves too much and nobody wants to follow an organization that cribs about itself. A marketing strategy that involves only self-promotional contents and nothing of real value will lead to nowhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JetBlue, a popular budget airline, completely acknowledges this and instead of posting special discounts and discounted fares, they use their social media handles to provide easy and fast customer services. It has followed its main goal of &quot;Inspiring humanity&quot; and done all the possible things to stay on the track, not only through serving their customers but also in their marketing messages. That&rsquo;s what helped it to have a strong hold on its core values. JetBlue campaigns such as FlyBabies, Flight Etiquette, and Human Kind a have set the bar high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s crucial to manage self-promotional content with data which is useful for your followers and always be spontaneous in responding to users whenever they interact with your web profiles. This will improve your relationship and will bring more confidence to your consumer. There are two key points that one should remember while planning the self-promotional strategies: stop selling hard and always remain honest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Do Benefit, Get Benefit :</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While creating a viral digital marketing campaign, search the content that is already there, put a twist on it in a way that it will provide value to someone else and you will receive the same.

This was an ideal issue to build a campaign on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Mastercard rana campaign titled the &quot;Sound of Priceless.&quot; They developed a sound meter to measure the loudness of the fans, and after measuring the sounds, they developed a video content around the story. To make the most out of it, they released the film online and on social networking sites just as the Cubs won the last session of the World Series. The outcomes were priceless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key to winning in such a strategy is patience, wait for the right time to get the maximum out your content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><br />\r\n5.

This makes it hard to achieve for startups and small businesses.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Around 50% of the business marketers</strong> <strong>think</strong> that traditional marketing leaves little or no room for audience interaction. This leads to potential difficulty in connecting with the audience and keeping them informed.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Near about 15% of the marketers believ</strong>e that unlike digital marketing, with the traditional form of marketing estimating the return on investment is tough.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Nearly 5% of the business marketers</strong> have already experienced that receiving customer feedback is very difficult with traditional marketing.

The consumers are evolving with digitalization and with the growth of technology their method of researching and purchasing is also changing dramatically.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>More than 85% of consumers read reviews</strong> and feedbacks about a service or product online before making a purchase.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Nearly 60% of the consumers</strong> use Facebook and Instagram every day.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Near about 94% of the B2B marketers</strong> use LinkedIn for online marketing purposes.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>According to the predictions for 2019, near about 70% of the total budget spent on ads</strong> will be directed towards mobile ads.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Near about 90% of the B2C marketers believe that social media</strong> is the best tactic for excellent content marketing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, let&rsquo;s dive into the following demographics and see how digital marketing has evolved and surpassed the traditional form of marketing over the years. According to the data of the year 2011, businesses spent comparatively less on online advertisements than on offline advertisements.

Since then the graph has always demonstrated an increasing expense on digital marketing and a decreasing investment in traditional marketing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe reason of this sharp shift in the way of marketing is probably the low cost associated with online advertising in comparison to the offline mode. Print Ads work amazingly in brand advertising, however, it demands a considerably huge investment. As per the data, a full page Ad in any leading magazine or newspaper would easily cost $196,535 for a circulation of 1 million. Moreover, the CPM is also higher in case of magazine ads. A full page black/white advertisement can cost you about $120K, for $50 USD worth CPM.

Hence, with digital marketing, even startups and small businesses with tight budget, can promote themselves through ads and increase sales.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the above discussion it is now crystal clear that digital marketing is the new king on the throne. Having said that, let us now go ahead and discuss digital marketing in details. We will check what is digital marketing and what the future of online advertisement is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the above figure, you can analyze that big business or start-ups are can use the digital marketing channels for enhancing the brand name and image. In case of the digital marketing approaches, the technologies are already proven and statistically declared as the most effective ways for offering great returns into the business, which is quite impossible for the traditional marketing tactics to overcome the challenge in the year 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ultimate winner is the digital marketing techniques, which are now trending in the marketplace, but, soon, the tactics will be improved in a better manner to challenge the upcoming changes in the year 2019.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Final Conclusion :</strong><br />\r\nFrom the above analysis, it can be concluded that digital marketing should be given due importance in modern times.

Shift the focus from only ensuring high traffic, and this year, rather place your bets on the strategies of conversion rate optimization. Keep the focus on quality over quantity for creating a sales funnel that will actually bring in the right customers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe great thing about conversion rate optimization is that it brings down the cost of customer acquisition and the average return on investments offered by the tools of CRO is 223%.

Refining The Voice Search:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSource :&nbsp;https://bit.ly/2RUaiFT<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy the year 2020, over 50% of all queries will be based on voice search, and the number of people using voice search rose by 60% in the last year alone. With most of the searches moving towards smart phones, there is no way for you to formulate a digital marketing strategy without incorporating voice search.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe better results that the voice search can provide on your website, the more are the chances for the visitors to interact with your brand. This year you need to refine your voice search technology to incorporate more natural languages and nuances of the varied dialects. This needs them to consider what the target audiences might use in the voice queries and also keep their focus on the long-tail keywords as the users are more likely to rely on those when making a query.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7.

When a customer looks for something, searches for a store nearby, wants to finalize a purchase, they can use the micro-moments to create targeted advertising and content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake an example of the &lsquo;want to go&rsquo; moments of the customers. The brick and mortar stores of the brands need to take advantage of such moments by banking on the &lsquo;near me&rsquo; searches, which have shown a two-times increase in 2017 alone, according to Google. The stores need to optimize their location on the apps and sites to garner more number of buyers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Leveraging AI and Machine Learning</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSource :&nbsp;https://bit.ly/2sTadmR<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe machine learning is one of the first practical gifts that artificial intelligence has given to the world of marketing.

Machine learning will help you in processing a large volume of data, spot similar patterns in different datasets, and make predictions based on the findings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is this last part that holds the most important for the digital marketers.

The major difference in machine learning this year is that it has become more accessible to everyone. The tools like Azure by Microsoft have made it possible for anyone to incorporate elements of machine learning algorithms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>9.

The oldest post-millennials, i.e., the ones born between 1998 and 2016, are now university graduates and they are all set to make their individual purchasing decisions. This makes 2019 the year to focus on this next-gen consumers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe millennials, with their lesser brand consciousness, more tech-savvy nature, and much more cynicism, rely more on the offerings of the brand and its way of communicating rather than how big its name is. Brands need to adapt the marketing strategies to cater to this rising generation Z as well as the older millennials.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>10.

This is the time when the quicker and quirkier you are in your content the higher is the chance for you to stay in the competition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the core fundamentals of marketing, like, to the point and crisp scripts, a strong brand and of course, a good product remain, there are certain trends that we need to focus on to stay in ahead in the digital marketing game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is the high-tech and always connected world where there are people who don&rsquo;t have homes to stay but own cell phones. Such circumstances have given rise to a need to use them in order to succeed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>We will see the 10 most important trends that I think will make the most impact in this New Year.</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Email Marketing :</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails still remain one of the major digital marketing tools. With the advent of Artificial Intelligence, marketing experts are able to personalize emails. Such emails make people believe in the brand and feel that they are being looked after.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>According to Experian, a simple chain of incomplete shopping cart emails are 2.4 times more likely to make the customer finish a purchase.</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Social Media :</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>With the increase in Smartphone usage<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the boost in smartphone usage, social media has become one of the majoravenues for brands to market their products. But, getting it right on any social media platform isn&rsquo;t easy. You need to find an effective way to create brand awareness among all the noise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake a look at the following stats from Social Media Examiner, to know which platform to focus more on:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe above image makes it clear that Facebook is the most popular platform. But it has stagnated in its growth. New users are more likely to use Instagram than Facebook. <strong>According to Simply Measured, 70% of the most used hashtags on Instagram are brands.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen we look at the surveys, the platform to focus on seems to be LinkedIn. It comes out to be the best platform in terms of conversion rates. This is the reason why <strong>94% of B2B marketers use it as per the Content Marketing Institute.&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Voice Search and Visual Search :</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Google algorithms updates are enough to keep all marketing people awake all night. Understanding user habits is also another chaotic experience. Voice Search and Visual Search should be looked at this year. Pinterest is using Visual Search and with Google Lens, Visual search is surely here to stay. Marketers can get one up on their competitors by jumping on these new search techniques.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Content Marketing :</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Content is King. It was and always will be. When content is engaging and relevant, users are more likely to stick and click. Content Marketing basically involves distribution, promotion and SEO.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Almost 96% (That&rsquo;s a huge number!!) of bloggers get consumers through social media.</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Advertising :</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Advertising has gone to the next level with the help of Artificial Intelligence. Using AI (Artificial Intelligence), you can automate ad buying to help target specific audiences. Advertising does help reach a wide audience but advertisers need to learn to capture the ever decreasing attention spans. It will remain a big part and to make money you need to start spending it.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Artificial Intelligence :</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Artificial Intelligence is now everywhere. May it be e-commerce websites or chatbots for customer service AI is everywhere. Using AI, it is very easy to analyze customer behavior,their search patterns their blogs or posts. This helps businesses understand their needs and map their products to these specific customer needs. Adopting AI will also help businesses reduce costs and also help in their growth.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Videos :</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a survey by <strong>Facebook, 94% of those surveyed had phones in hand when watching TV</strong>. The results showed that even when watching TV, people are generally focussed more on their phones.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>More than 50% of videos are watched on mobile. This shows that as mobile consumption increases, video consumption too will increase</strong>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA Video doesn&rsquo;t mean just YouTube, for maximum video engagement, you can look at Instagram, Facebook and even LinkedIn. Starting a live video and including glimpses of making the product, the research involved, etc. can make for great video marketing.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Messaging :</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Research shows that messaging apps have become increasingly popular now. Even though face to face communication has become sparse, people do want a personal live chat. Many customers actually prefer to interact on live chats even when they&rsquo;re chatbots as they feel they are getting immediate solutions or attention. The AI-powered chatbots engage customers any time of day or night.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Influencers :</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you find out your target audience, it also helps to identify who influences this audience the most. Using influencers is a very effective marketing technique, and it attracts customers. From celebrities to bloggers, YouTubers and even journalists anyone can be an influencer. They help spread a good word of your brand among their followers through the platform of their choice. When they tell people to indulge in something, people often listen as they believe in them and have had good experiences in the past.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Mobile :</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the mobile usage trends below, its safe to say that this is a medium that should not be overlooked. The amount of time people spend on their mobile devices is ever increasing and its high time brands utilize this to their advantage.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMobile phones are no longer the new things on the block. They have almost become a necessity. <strong>According to Google&rsquo;s 2017 survey, mobile usage for online transactions is over 40%.</strong> They also say that smartphone users are much more likely to use their phones for purchase than they were a year ago.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Over 91% of users attribute their purchases to relevant ads</strong>. So brands who have not quite taken advantage of this handy device, its time to take notice or fall behind forever.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Takeaways :</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the things we can surely conclude is that emails are most relevant even now. The relevancy of the email content though is what will increase the conversion rate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen it comes to social media, brands should decide which one to focus on depending on their product as social media is all about published content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA good mobile-friendly site is much more likely to convert a potential customer than ever before. So, brands need to pull up their socks and clean up their sloppy codes in order to be mobile friendly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em><strong>In the end, to be up to speed with the latest and upcoming trends is what will keep you in the running for the long haul.</strong></em><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>', '1587719753.jpg', '1587719753.jpg', '10 Most Important Digital Marketing Stats You Should Know in 2019 - Doors Studio', 'Read Doors Studio\'s blog here about 10 Most Important Digital Marketing Stats You Should Know in 2019', '10 Most Important Digital Marketing Stats You Should Know in 2019', 'active', '2019-02-26 10:24:19', '2020-04-24 03:45:53'),
(9, 1, 1, '5 Reasons Why PPC is Important for Your Business in 2019', '5-reasons-why-ppc-is-important-for-your-business-in-2019', '<p>The Marketing budget is especially precious if you have a small business. Also, many are apprehensive when it comes to new marketing and advertising techniques. We have seen a major shift in marketing and advertising over the past year and one of the things that gained momentum was PPC advertising.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is PPC?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>PPC is pay-per-click. This is basically a platform for online marketing. Here, the advertiser agrees to pay the search engine a specific amount every time his ad is clicked. So, basically, it is a way to buy visits to your website. This platform is very simple and straight forward. There are no hidden costs. You pay a search engine a pre-decided cost to list your ad in the top slots. Whenever your ad is clicked, you will pay the decided PPC cost to the search engine from your budget. Once the budget is exhausted, the search engine will stop your ads.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>There are many advantages of PPC Ads that can be seen from the trends this past year and which will continue in this Year also. Some of them are listed below:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Brand Awareness :</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>When a brand starts implementing SEO, it takes time for their brand to be visible. Many combinations have to be done with the keywords and relevant content to get to the top of the results page. However, with PPC your business is visible instantly and that too to a relevant audience. According to the analysis done by Word stream, the top three ads on a search results page get 41% of clicks.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople may be able to distinguish between ads and organic links on the search results page. But the results vary and findings show that 36%-50% of consumers usually fall for ads and fail to make out the difference between them and organic content.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Maximize ROI (Return On Investment) :</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The amount you pay for a click may not hamper your budget. Also, if you pay $5 for a click but it results in a $200 business for you then you have gained much more than what you spent. So, your business has a chance to maximize its ROI and create full proof campaigns.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, you can revise the PPC budget according to your needs. It is a given that a small budget won&rsquo;t get you returns and the search results depend on many things including keywords.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, PPC will provide you with an ROI higher than any other marketing technique.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Target Relevant Audiences by PPC&nbsp;Ads :</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>PPC is a targeted and ensured way of reaching your relevant audience. The PPC platform provides you access to many factors like location, demographics, time of day, keywords etc. This enables you to target your audience with precision.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are many businesses that profit from advertising locally rather than on a global level. Google, in a study, found that almost 75% of online consumers prefer to visit stores that have relevant information in search results.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>ReTargeting Ads</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>ReTargeting Ads can also be done which is nothing but targeting those customers that have already visited your business once. Showing them ads regularly may lead them to visit again when the need arises.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Generate Quality&nbsp;Leads with PPC Ads :</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>PPC is in the later stage of the marketing funnel when leads are more interested in results. Such an audience will click on the ad with the motive of getting a solution. According to Wordstream, people looking to &ldquo;buy now&quot; click paid ads 65% of the times. So, you should target this audience by adding relevant keywords like &ldquo;buy now&rdquo;, &ldquo;who sells&rdquo;, &ldquo;best price&rdquo;, &nbsp;and &ldquo;cheapest&rdquo;. If you link your ads to your products you will see better results.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Drive Instant Traffic to Your Website :</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This platform is one of the proven ones to bring immediate traffic to your site. Also, this platform can be setup easily and is not time-consuming at all. Also, you get conversion oriented traffic. Also, the amount of traffic generated depends on how much you&rsquo;re ready to pay. This ensures that you get relevant traffic and also the amount of traffic that you can handle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQualified and relevant traffic is driven to your website. This also ensures a high conversion rate. A higher conversion rate also leads to good ROI.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, PPC helps SEO as it helps in ranking. The top PPC platforms are Google, Facebook, Instgram, Yahoo and then Bing. The largest advertisers are Google Ads with a holding of 37.2% of the digital advertising market and Facebook Ads with 19.6% of the digital advertising market.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdvertisers are now looking towards Bing for advertising instead of keeping all their ads on Google.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion :</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We can safely say that <a href=\"http://www.doorsstudio.com/pay-per-click-advertising.php\">PPC Ads Strategy</a>&nbsp;. it is good to add it to your marketing strategy.

(IAB)</li>\r\n	<li>According to a Google survey in 2011, as many as a whopping 58% of users expect fast and quickly loading mobile sites.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSo, it is safe to say that mobiles cannot be ignored anymore. User habits have evolved so much that there are internet users who have never accessed a website using a computer/laptop. Also, the number of such users is increasing by the day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven web development has evolved,and the need to create separate sites for every device has vanished.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nResponsive website design has paved the way for creating single website for multiple devices.

You can use up to 30 hashtags so, use a good 20 combination which is of general hashtags around the product having good reach (you will know this as Instagram intimates you about the number of people using that particular hashtag).</li>\r\n	<li>You can use designated tools as well for the same. There are few to name, like <strong>Sprout Social, Later, Hubspot; they do the scheduling and planning as per your Instagram</strong>. They eliminate the hit and trial pattern, and with the intellect of highly functional software, they analyze your audience, timing, and their dynamic behavior.</li>\r\n	<li>It also depends on the type of audience and area you are in. Dynamics change as per the city, country, and continent you are in as well. Let&rsquo;s see how we have to use these dynamics when it comes to Indian subcontinent i.e. India, to be exact.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Being in India, we are subjected to a lot of festivals and due to globalization, we are now celebrating almost every festival, important dates, and other related things. Such occasions are the best way to create content which is relevant to the audience at that moment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leveraging them is also a part of this process and an example as to how time, day and mood could be integrated and if done correctly can generate great results for your Instagram platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>To get into more details like what time of the day and day is important when comes to posting on Instagram is India, a report from Sprout Social gives statistics that goes like:</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Monday between 1 pm to 3 pm and after 7 pm</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Wednesday at 3:00 p.m.</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Thursday at 5:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m. and between 3:00 to 4:00 p.m.</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Friday at or after 3 pm.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If we compare it with the CDT zone, the behavior of the timeline, like the time of day and day is almost on similar lines.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can see Thursday still being the best day having a lot of time caps to post, topping this list and other, proving that it is indeed the best day to post if you like to fetch desirable and favorable reach for your Instagram post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But social media by the end of the day is a fun place to put yourself and your business forward to create a Brand. Along with this, content should be your prime focus as good content will not go unnoticed. With it, being consistent, engaging and upbeat with the trends is another way to up your Instagram page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To add on, analytics are there to help you with a good reach, not mental stress. So, sole purpose is not to keep up with them all the time and to measure success and failure accordingly, as there is not one-shot formula, so never let analytics take over the success you have earned so far be sabotaged and diluted.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important thing is to create relationships and community along with importance much important to analytics because the only thing they show is the pattern and behavior of those people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have command and connections, bonds and relationships within the community then they will automatically lift your brand as high chances are that these people are your existing or potential customers and their loyalty with the brand is your leverage to create a successful Instagram Presence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can find more about Instagram and <a href=\"https://www.doorsstudio.com/social-media-marketing.php\">Social Media Marketing here</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\nAuthor:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Vanshikha Kanojia is a&nbsp;prolific writer at <a href=\"https://www.doorsstudio.com\">Doors Studio</a> and has been writing professionally since five years.

Clearly, the cards are in favor of social media marketing, that is why many businesses are shifting to it for making their market more effectively in the marketplace.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the statistics are not much clear on which platform as a marketer you should prefer more when comes to launching a campaign.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet&rsquo;s move forward to understand as to how to actually distinguish between these two when comes to launching a brand on them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><br />\r\nFeatures of Instagram and Facebook</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>No doubt both of these platforms are amazing when comes to interaction and engagement, hence ensuring you better ROI.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFacebook is older than Instagram and is having a bigger user base in comparison.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBoth are now under Zuckerberg, who bought Instagram back in 2012, two years after it was launched.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt goes without saying that both platforms are great for advertising but, still both have different advantages when it comes to introducing a social media campaign on each of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\n<strong>Let&rsquo;s make a difference in various parameters to actually deduce which one is the best!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Engagement:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To give you an idea, Facebook has about 60 million business pages. But the engagement rate over a facebook page is less than a business account on Instagram.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaving said that, Instagram is more pro Images rather than videos. Facebook, on the other hand, have about 8 million views when comes to videos; Instagram has a lower reach.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Both of them indicate two things clearly.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Instagram is great if you are planning Photo Campaigns</li>\r\n	<li>Facebook is better to be used for Video Ads</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Target Audience</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to being in the market longer than Instagram, Facebook gets the advantage of having an enormous audience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut you will find the generations more active over Facebook. Instagram is a more millennial thing and the place where you can tap into the generation Z.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere, you will have to analyze the market of your product and then get into which platform fits the bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is easier to choose after that application that, if a product is something which will interest the older generation then it is better to target them over Facebook and if the audience is relatively younger than choose Instagram.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Optimized as per Mobile Usage</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Facebook interface is adaptable to <em><strong>all the platforms: desktops, tablets and smartphones</strong></em>, you can use almost every tool available.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut there is a constraint when comes to Instagram. It doesn&rsquo;t provide the same flexibility, also you can&rsquo;t use desktops to efficiently use them, like for posting ads, or posts &amp; stories in general.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInstagram is more mobile-friendly for the very reason that people can share their life updates quickly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smartphones have taken over the market and usage is also dominated by the same.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTherefore, a Facebook campaign must be optimized carefully as per mobile phones and Instagram is anyway highly optimized for such campaigns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Type of Advertisements</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Facebook, you can post a lot of different types of ads like Video, Image, Carousel, Collection, events and so on.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVariety is a there on Facebook, whereas on Instagram only 4 types exist:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Photo</li>\r\n	<li>Video</li>\r\n	<li>Story</li>\r\n	<li>Carousel</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, you definitely have more options when comes to options when comes to Facebook but Instagram Story Ads are very effective.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFacebook&rsquo;s Carousel and Collection also fetch great ROI. But can we say that any one of them is better? Well, that is hard to pick.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis again depends upon the demographic and the type of business of yours is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cost-effectiveness on Ads</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both platforms have costly ad campaigns. As per few statistics over the Internet, <strong>Facebook is about $0.27 CPC and $7.19 CPM whereas Instagram ads cost about $1.41 CPC and $7.91 CPM. </strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, established is the fact that money can&rsquo;t be a point of difference and advantage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen, <em><strong>how to invest in looking at the cost?&nbsp; What should be the criteria? </strong></em>Considering the above factors, you look into:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The kind of strategy you are using for your brand will be one factor.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Look into the purpose of the ad and then take your pick</li>\r\n	<li>Your social media is like a long time investment, don&rsquo;t expect fast returns. This ain&rsquo;t cost.</li>\r\n	<li>The demographics used in the formation of an ad, use them carefully. Be clear about the area, age and other aspects of your audience when you are constructing your Ad.</li>\r\n	<li>Quality over Quantity. Focus on your content and visual along with it</li>\r\n	<li>Hashtags are your strength. Use them wisely.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>It has been a long comparison showing the pros and cons of both sides.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFacebook being older than Instagram got that trust and recognition but Instagram is the Millennial wildfire with absolutely no stopping.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContent is getting consumed on a daily basis. The shift to social media by companies is the indicator.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore than these analytics, there is also the quality of your content, your hard work, consistency, and strategy which goes into making any campaign successful.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon&rsquo;t forget the organic source of popular which could be done through SEO optimization as that is cost-effective and has long-lasting results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other than this, a faith of consumer in your brand and product also make the campaign successful, there is nothing like a loyal consumer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if talking about whether to choose any one amongst both of these platforms, there is no fight but a smart approach.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing the insights just shared, you can use both of them to your advantage without spending too much money but just using your intellect.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn an endnote, both of them should be used keeping in mind their best qualities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Author:</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nVanshikha Kanojia is a prolific writer at <a href=\"https://www.doorsstudio.com/\">Doors Studio</a> and has been writing professionally since five years.

Not only is it the backbone but it covers every aspect of your website, from SEO to Customer Service! But to analyze your UX, there are a lot of factors you have to keep in mind since the digital space is dynamic and predicting user&rsquo;s behavior is a tricky task But before hitting that topic, let&rsquo;s talk about what is UX in the first place.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What is UX?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>UX stands for User experience which means that the interaction of your user has with your website and their response to it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are several factors that influence a website&rsquo;s UX, naming few like Website Design, Form Design and so on.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUX is important because it is directly proportional to the desirability of your website by the user.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the UX is of poor quality, you will see higher bounce rates and lower ranking of your website.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn top of it, the expectations to build a rapport with your user goes downhill and the brand loses interaction with the user, for which the whole website is established in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Improving the experience over the website becomes essential to create a seamless relationship between the user and the product/service.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Why UX is important?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Businesses need to drastically change to deliver value for users earlier, faster, and more clearly.&rdquo;</strong><br />\r\n<em><strong>Caio Braga &amp; Fabricio Teixeira , UX Design Experts</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement above clearly explains the dynamic nature of the user and websites need to keep up with that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver the Internet, people expect speed and if not delivered they get frustrated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTheir disinterest in your website because of slow page load time, difficult navigation or any product backlog could create trouble for you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are other things which come under the radar of a good UX like:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Content: Visual and Written</li>\r\n	<li>Proof like customer reviews, ratings and recommendations</li>\r\n	<li>Unnecessary steps or landing pages</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The main reason of UX being dominant is the factor that it helps you understand your audience, they expectations, needs and aspirations from your product particularly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;<br />\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Can UX lead to better conversions?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We have been talking about how important UX is and an determinant in knowing the user as well.

Also, LinkedIn is distinct from other platforms because it is solely for professional use. The way LinkedIn needs to be used is also different and altogether a different game.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Following are the ways in which LinkedIn let you showcase you as an individual :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>It will be the roadmap of your whole career; from where you started and where you currently working, everything.</li>\r\n	<li>Also, you can mention your educational qualifications; where you went to school, college and so on.</li>\r\n	<li>You can also connect with who you work with and they can recommend and vouch for your skills as an employee and several other things.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from all this, very few understand and know that their businesses could also be promoted and marketed over LinkedIn, just like they endorse them on other platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there are ways in which you can promote your business over LinkedIn and can reap great results as well! But before that, there are things you need to do</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Take your Business to LinkedIn | Connect with Professionals</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Just like on Facebook you can create pages, like that you can create a business page of your company with information mentioned like:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>What is your business about</li>\r\n	<li>Where is your office</li>\r\n	<li>How many employees work with you and so on.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So, this way you can create a proper portfolio of the company as well to put it out there for people who would want to know about the company and even for the ones who landed up on your profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that your profile is created and properly filled with the information required, the next thing is to use features LinkedIn provides you with just like Instagram Q&amp;A and Facebook status.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Linked In Polls</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Any social media is about engagement, as that will create a sense of community also it leads to the better reach of the platform. Therefore, LinkedIn has a feature where you can put polls about a certain business-related situation or anything which the audience is likely to respond over. So, you can create a poll and circulate in your network or amongst peers. LinkedIn also allows you to have insights where you can watch the results on a real-time basis and analyze them there and then as to what is the narrative by the people.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Address the Queries</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You should write blogs related to your business to educate and spread knowledge, but it also serves other purposes. People when you get to know that relevant knowledge is on your page, your audience will look forward to your blog whenever you will publish.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTherefore, your task is to create high-quality content so that people stop and read regardless. But the work is not finished there. You will get queries as well on such blogs and your work begin. You must address their queries; either write a comment back to them or you can create that query into a blog as well. Interesting right?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Leverage from LinkedIn Groups</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This is another feature of LinkedIn which coincides with Facebook, wherein you could part of different groups. You can take advantage of such groups. The idea is to be an active member, interact and communicate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhenever you do so, try to leave a mark, like where your designation or share any information from your company which might be relevant to that group you are in. You can also publish your blogs and other useful insights in general so that people can get to know about you and your business&#39;s presence.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Create your own Group</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With colleagues, peers and people associated with your company, you must create a group which stir conversations that is your company or industry-centric, therefore you would be able to build a community which is actually like your cheerleaders who eventually will share this information with other people, might ask people even to join your group for such knowledge and this way you will be able to build a vast network.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Status</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Have something important to convey? Job recruitments? Office event? You can post about any such announcement through the Status feature. You can share other things as well like blog &nbsp;, any special offer if you are a brand and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Post Ads</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Time and again you need to switch to paid marketing to enhance your presence on online platforms. Therefore, the idea here is to target the audience based on company size, age and gender, geography and so on.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLinkedIn DirectAds helps you curate such ads be it a post, blog, job recruitments alerts and anything which needs that sort of boost. This will bring new visitors and traction of the right sort and that is what exactly your page needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Job Alerts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is an indirect way in which you can put yourself out there. People are always on a lookout for jobs, be it full time or internships, they are feverishly looking for places where they can find a job. LinkedIn is that one market place where they can find decent jobs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLinkedIn allows you post jobs and that can bring a lot of traffic and visibility to your business page as the applicant would want to know about the company as well and that you would have explained already in detail on the page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few other things which you can do. You can ask your clients to give you recommendations over LinkedIn as that will create a positive impact for the future clients as that could be the point of validation they can get from other people you have worked with.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe next thing you could is to use the LinkedIn app as well to get constant updates and alerts as to what is happening on your page along with that can browse through your competitors as well to understand trends and narratives which you might have missed somehow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion :</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The conclusion is that LinkedIn is the oldest social media platform which is underrated and not properly valued by the users. The agenda is to take that advantage which many of your competitors might not have taken when comes to socially promoting their businesses. Hence, take your chances to establish a good presence over LinkedIn since it is primarily for professionals and that is what makes LinkedIn different from other social media platforms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy <a href=\"https://www.doorsstudio.com/\">Doors Studio</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.doorsstudio.com/social-media-marketing.php\">Consult for Social Media Marketing</a></p>', '1587720401.jpg', '1587720401.jpg', 'Doors Studio - How to promote your business on Linkedin?', 'Read Doors Studio blog about - How to promote your business on Linkedin?', 'How to promote your business on Linkedin?', 'active', '2019-08-30 08:07:48', '2020-04-24 03:56:41'),
(21, 1, 1, 'How to use Social Media Insights for better ROI?', 'how-to-use-social-media-insights-for-better-roi', '<p><strong>ROI</strong> stands for Return on Investment that means, whatever a business invests in, it expects a certain amount of profit or loss on that particular investment which it will eventually incur.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the case is completely different when comes to Social Media, the ROI stands out to be a little different.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although, to expect real business from social media is not an unrealistic expectation, but there is no guarantee attached to it as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But ROI for social media can have a significant role which one expects eventually out of any sort of marketing and that is Brand Awareness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of platforms use social media as a PR as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social media is now the face of any organization where they can craft their own brand image without any additional help.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The platform itself is so accessible and easy to handle, also people are using it personally hence some knowledge is derived from there as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But apart from the important part it plays, it is difficult to understand the ROI which social media actually generates.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, we are first going to talk about the importance of Social Media ROI and then how to easily figure out how to measure the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with how to actually use Social Media for your brand&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Believe it or not, in 2019, your business / brand needs that social media presence</strong>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt could be for the sake of awareness or just customer experience/service, either way, you require your brand to be out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Purpose of your Social Media</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As discussed, social media ROI could not be just something you could measure in cash or conversions but, a solid media brand awareness and engagement goes a long way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a lot of brands just there to experiment content, generate brand-relevant content and engage with their consumers. There is also a part in engagement which we can turn as customer service, which is very direct and convenient via social media.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The point here is that your social media could be anything you want it to be, the only thing which needs clarification is your purpose out of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, you can use both organic and paid medium of social media marketing. If your investments allow you, then you must use a combination of both, time to time, to grow and build a strong community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conclusion is that there is no specific strategy to use your social media, hence a permutation &amp; combination works in this case. And even your purpose could change from time to time, according to the requirement of your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set Goals</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You need milestones and time allotment to those specific goals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is that your social media should look like when comes to aesthetic, followers and reach, these are the common areas on which your social media get judged.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this is what the audience expects, therefore, your goal must be something which is the amalgamation of both as that will help in the growth and fulfillment of your goals as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A piece of advice to keep in mind that your goals are nothing if your community base is to in sync or support of it. Therefore,</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Set realistic goals</li>\r\n	<li>Analyze the market, audience and your competitors</li>\r\n	<li>Keep a tab on the progress of your goals</li>\r\n	<li>Revise and Improvise your strategy time to time as per the trends</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Measure your goals</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Once goals are set and along with that the campaigns as well, the next thing is to keep those goals in check.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only thing you need to check is that if the content you are generating for your brand is fetching you, visitors, reach and popularity or not. You can easily check this by using Google Analytics</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Track your social media expenses</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As the parameter of ROI is different for social media, the expenses incurred are also different.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we see the time invested, the content generated, tools given utilized and paid campaigns we spent money on. All of these will guide you whether your campaign is generating positive or negative results for your brand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After knowing the importance of using Social Media for generating ROI, you understand that a thorough optimization of content is the first thing you need to do on your social media platform. Your goals give you that clarity as to how and when to optimize or revamp your content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose might get diluted or change in the course of time, but the strategy needs to be changed accordingly as the requirement of a business is never constant and is ever so dynamic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though you need to keep a track of what your social media is reaping, how your strategies are panning out but the measure of success is not just in the analytics.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are creating valuable business-client relationships than that is one thing you must consider as profit derived. Other things like, good content and greater engagement between consumers as well, which by the end establishes a community is also a metric you should focus upon.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Now we shall move to how you can actually use Social Media Insights to Analyse your ROI&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Once you have worked thoroughly on your social media to generate a good ROI, the next step is to check to know if the strategies are working or not!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In-app Tools:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Platforms like Facebook and Instagram have their own insight tools where you can check the graph precisely divided amongst different categories like age group, area/location, time, date, and other demographics. You can find these insights which are available in the app itself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can constantly check the graph, compare and conclude what strategy and what point of time was fruitful enough.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will make you understand the demographics of your audience and that will impact your strategies effectively in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Overall engagement:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You will eventually see a lot of traffic and engagement and that can be seen in the form of comments, shares, and people tagging you in their posts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;If your brand-specific hashtag is used by people in their posts, that is a sign to measure. You can directly search your hashtag and see the amounts of posts under that hashtag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This indicates directly the interest of your audience and gives you an idea of what sort of creatives or visuals they like to see on your social media platform, indirectly streamlining your thought process with the consumer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Number of Followers:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of following is also a marker that people are actually interested in your profile and that is why they are following from their social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you thought about it deeply, an individual will only be following you for two reasons, they want an update of your product/service or they are thoroughly entertained by your presentation on social media or both.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A constant increase is a sign that your target is hitting well in the spot.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Feedbacks</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you see a lot of reviews, either on the website, facebook or through Instagram comments or DMs, it is a sign that people are using your product/service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These reviews also help you &lsquo;up your game&rsquo; if a consumer comes with a query or grievance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a strategic point of view, people are actually thinking you take up their grievances seriously, therefore they are approaching you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means they are having trust in the brand and in your credibility overall. A clean chit as to you having people&rsquo;s faith in you wholeheartedly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Few more ways in which you can improve your social media ROI are:</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Use test campaigns when in doubt about a certain idea. It might not work that tremendously, but some amount of traction will be there. If you see not too much engagement you always have the option of pulling out that campaign.

(23, 1, 1, 'How to use Twitter in your social media strategy?', 'how-to-use-twitter-in-your-social-media-strategy', '<p>Twitter is right now rapidly increasing to become the platform thoroughly loved by the masses, but the issue and major problem are that people aren&#39;t well equipped to know how to exactly use Twiter when it comes to a social media strategy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf we talked about the consumption of Twitter, there are about 500K tweets that are sent per minute on Twitter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeat that! The strategy to use it is not in using the right hashtags, posting at the right time and being viral or trendy. It is much more than that.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Let&rsquo;s delve into how we can most out of this immensely interactive platform when comes to brands.</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>1.&nbsp; 139 Million Active users</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The numbers are mindblowing. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you are using these statistics perfectly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith such a huge database, here it gets proven that there is a certain need of having a twitter account for your brand as such a platform isn&rsquo;t something you should give up on.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut with these figures, comes satisfaction but also the urgency to have a strategy which is utilizing these numbers aptly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou need to know as to what is your market and the need is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are you using Twitter because:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You want to generate leads for your brand</li>\r\n	<li>To have customer awareness and loyalty</li>\r\n	<li>Cut down on Customer Service Expense</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The importance of having a clear goal is that then you are in a position to even formulate an actionable strategy as well, which helps you streamline your approach and to go haywire while executing the strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2.&nbsp; Have a Separate Twitter profile</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It has been given emphasis time and again about how important it is to have a separate Business Profile for your brand. You mustn&rsquo;t merge it with your personal profile or use your personal forum to publicize your brand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt jeopardizes the brand image and authenticity terribly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHave a separate profile, with your brand&rsquo;s logo or name as the profile picture and a short and crisp bio explaining your brand and your business in general; it could be a quote, one-liner or just a small paragraph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next step is to get verified by twitter so that the authenticity of your brand in social space is proven legit and trustworthy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, don&rsquo;t forget to link other social media platforms where your brand is present.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA crossover would really help maintain traction and communication on various platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Importance of 3rd Party Platforms</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>People constantly sharing content in various formats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSharing tweets is the next big thing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople forward it across Instagram, Facebook and websites use them in their blog as a reference if they are writing of a particular brand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis exposure is immense and constant and according to statistics is also bringing new users to Twitter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe number is 1.6 billion unique visitors. Why would you want to miss such exposure?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTherefore, Twitter is a platform promising exposure on their own platform but across various other platforms as well, including Television!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4.Twitter Hashtags: Eternal Romance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Where all these trends come from?&nbsp; Ever occurred to you?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo doubt people highly associate hashtags with Instagram but Twitter actually make them go viral!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is the actual birthplace of the trending hashtags for you to use and if followed religiously can be advantageous for your brand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStatistics indicate that if they are used properly can increase about 50% of your brand engagement. But how to even use them?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe approach is far more different from what you have applied to your Instagram business account. Here,</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You mustn&rsquo;t use more than a couple of hashtags, unlike the 30 hashtags you use on a usual Instagram post.</li>\r\n	<li>Use more of trending hashtags to increase visibility and engagement</li>\r\n	<li>You must not use much space or use punctuation while putting hashtags in your tweet.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Best time to post?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As discussed, almost every minute there are about 500K tweets. Does that mean you should post every minute? ABSOLUTELY NOT!</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>When comes to the best day to tweet it is Friday and worst is Sunday</li>\r\n	<li>Time slot: 9 am - 10 am, safest is 10 am - 12 pm</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>But they are numbers and every twitter account differs as per individual demographic. So using a more generic approach, you must:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Post every day so that consistency and engagement are stable and it will help to have the traction you desire. Make sure you consider the time slot mentioned above.</li>\r\n	<li>Also, if you think that the above time slot is not what is working for your platform, consider using twitter analytics to get hold of that right time to post on your profile.</li>\r\n	<li>Since we have busy schedules, you must use the scheduling feature given by platforms like Sprout Social to queue your posts so that they are always on time as per your strategy.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>6.Key Engagement?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You mustn&rsquo;t just create a great post and let it be on your tweet, the battle is just halfway won. The next step is engagement. How will you increase that?</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Be a silent observer of your consumer, which will give you a lot of insight, leading to a better understanding of your consumer&rsquo;s behavior apart from using the analytics to get the idea of demographics.</li>\r\n	<li>Engage with your consumers on their platforms as well. But don&rsquo;t be a stalker, do it very professionally and eloquently.</li>\r\n	<li>This engagement will lead you to understand what you should post and that will surely attract your consumer to engage with you in return as well. Be vigilant in replying to them so that you don&rsquo;t miss out on their tweet reply on your posts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These six steps are integral as to how to go about your Twitter when you launch your brand on it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery social media platform is different, therefore, it never mixes the approaches when come to them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPoint is to treat each of your social media platforms very individualistically so that you can retrieve the maximum out of their traction that they over to your presence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere will be developments in the dynamics but you must keep up with them to get better and best out of them, but few basics like the ones we discussed will remain the ones we discussed above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By <a href=\"https://www.doorsstudio.com/\">Doors Studio</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read More About <a href=\"https://www.doorsstudio.com/social-media-marketing.php\">Social Media Marketing &amp; Strategies</a></p>', '1587720516.jpg', '1587720516.jpg', 'How to use Twitter in your social media strategy? - Doors Studio', 'Read Doors Studio Blog about  - How to use Twitter in your social media strategy?', 'How to use Twitter in your social media strategy?', 'active', '2019-09-06 07:51:56', '2020-04-24 03:58:36');

(24, 1, 1, 'How to take advantage of Influencer Marketing when comes to Social Media', 'how-to-take-advantage-of-influencer-marketing-when-comes-to-social-media', '<p>Gone are the days when a celebrity was needed to endorse any brand. Social media changed the narrative when it comes to Influencer Marketing. Now, it is all about working with the right social media influencers to hit the target audience. There are so many social media niche centric influencers, having a massive following that a lot of marketing and brand awareness can be generated through this technique.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>But what and how Influencer marketing works?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Influencer marketing is basically a collaboration between the brand and the social media influencers who are relevant to the brand in achieving the presence it is striving from the digital space.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf we talk about the major markets like the US and UK, there they used 10% of their marketing budget invested in influencer marketing. This indicates that this field of marketing is picking up momentum and needs to be given attention and strategy. But how can one use this to their advantage? Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>There are a few things you should have to take care of before opting a social media influencers.</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Competence:</strong> You need to see whether the person/influencer you are choosing for the brand understands your brand&rsquo;s niche and needs.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Outreach:</strong> Is their platform engaging and aesthetic? Will it bring attention to your product?</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Followers:</strong> The persona they are carrying, is it in synergy with your brand or not? Are they followed by people who are relevant to your brand?</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Social Image:</strong> Are they well-liked by their followers? What sort of image do they carry as an influencer?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>These are the four important questions you must ask yourself before picking up your influencer.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf they don&rsquo;t set well in these criteria, then you have to think about why they should even endorse your brand?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Apart from them, there are factors that play an important role in making of Influencer market a success.</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Audience Personas</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Can an influencer know your brand better than you? Maybe, maybe not but you need to understand your brand and your audience well. That will set the focus as to which influencer will fit your brand. It can&rsquo;t happen until you know the demographics well enough to even allocate or appoint an influencer to work on it. Finding a renowned influencer is not the battle won, but just begun.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Monitor your Engagement</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Influencers in this age are not celebrities but social media identities. They are in a strong position because they are able to hook the audience to the content, or the lives they are living which people are interested to be a part of it. But when it comes to your product, is there engagement on their posts? You have to be vigilant and can&rsquo;t just leave on the influencer&rsquo;s popularity.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Aesthetics</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Influencer marketing is heavily dependant on the aesthetics because the visual form of social media platforms calls for such qualities. The content they create, its look, feel and appeal should be in sync with yours for the sole purpose of you using that content on your feed as well. It mustn&rsquo;t look out of the blue as that will disrupt the flow of your feed. These things should be discussed and taken care of before opting for an influencer.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Organic is Long Lasting</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You ask any social media marketer, they will advice non-paid marketing any day over &lsquo;paid-marketing&rsquo;. Paid marketing gives an instant boost, but organic marketing is pivotal when comes to a long-lasting community if you are on the lookout to have one. The same comes to influencer marketing. If your influencer is using paid marketing to promote themselves, then the reach they are generating through this channel is not long-lasting and consistent. Therefore, an influencer with an organic reach and following should be your choice so that the traffic they generated so far is converted into your following as well since organic followers are more loyal and committed to the content the influencer generate rather than the ones who constantly use paid marketing to boost their reach.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Know Your Influencer Well</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t approach the influencer without having a thorough knowledge of their content, their background, and their audience. To generate a healthy relationship between your platform and the influencer&rsquo;s audience, you must interact and engage with them as well. For this, you need to know them, and then accordingly establish relations with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>But there are few challenges you might face onboarding an Influencer, that would be:</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Budget:</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Influencers with phenomenal reach will not settle for free products, you need to have a good budget pre-hand if you are looking for influencers with a solid following and reach. You can try to hire them on a commission basis which will eradicate the problem of reducing the fee or paying a flat fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Reaching Out:</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Influencers are hard to get hold of. But then what is the right approach to reach that particular influencer you really think is best for your brand? You have got to go a little personal. You need to individually direct message them. Yes, it could be tedious but shows sincerity and interest of yours. But the message should be drafted in such a way that it shouldn&rsquo;t reflect too much frankness yet be very professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a brand&rsquo;s point of view, it could be overwhelming as well that someone else, not involved in the brand is endorsing the brand but you need to have faith and give your influencer the creative space to create content accordingly. Healthy monitoring must always be there but too much control might lead to poor content or even worse, discontinuation. So, it is also there that you yourself have to be convinced before giving any influencer your brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all of this, comes the most important part,</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How to track your Influencer Marketing Campaign?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The success of any campaign isn&rsquo;t just about the increasing number of likes, comments or simply put, the engagement. That&rsquo;s a part of it not entirely the outcome. You are selling a product or service at the end of the day. Therefore, in pure business terms, you need an increase in sales, no matter how important awareness is. You can track that when comes to influencer marketing through:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>UTM PARAMETER</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>According to Hootsuite,&nbsp;</strong><em>&quot;UTM parameters might sound really technical, but they&rsquo;re actually very simple and easy to use. They&rsquo;re just short text codes that you add to all of the links in your social posts. They provide three key benefits:&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>They help you track the value of social marketing programs and campaigns.</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>They provide precise data about where traffic and conversions come from.</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>They allow you to test individual posts head-to-head in classic A/B testing style.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, it defines the source from where the traffic over the website, or any other portal has been directed. Your influencer having his/her unique UTM will help you in tracking the campaign&rsquo;s success or failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Discount Code</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a comparatively easier way to track the progress than creating a special UTM. Discount codes are both beneficial from sales and marketing point of view because they attract people and help you keep a track as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Product Wise</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The influencer you are working along must be promoting a particular product or product range, to begin with. You need to monitor the popularity, growth, and sales of that particular to measure the growth of that campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is an old concept but with a breath of fresh air, but apart from the face value and dynamics, nothing much has changed about influencer marketing and it is still very relevant and popular among the marketing tools a marketer looks forward to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.doorsstudio.com/\">Doors Studio</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read More About <a href=\"https://www.doorsstudio.com/digital-marketing-agency-in-uae-abudhabi-ras-al-khaimah-dubai-sharjah.php\">Digital&nbsp;Media Marketing &amp; Strategies</a></p>', '1587720547.jpg', '1587720547.jpg', 'Doors studio - How to take advantage of Influencer Marketing when comes to Social Media?', 'Read Doors Studio blog about - How to take advantage of Influencer Marketing when comes to Social Media?', 'How to take advantage of Influencer Marketing when comes to Social Media', 'active', '2019-09-13 07:10:12', '2020-04-24 03:59:07'),

From laptops to smartwatches, they are ruling the lives we are living right now. This has now become a mechanism to understand customers, their behavior and needs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn this pretext of this, AI is gelling well with digital marketing, as the strategies are being more protective as the consumer insights are given. Also, as compared to survey reports and other old school methods of data collecting, this has been more cost-effective and time-efficient.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>But before delving more into the topic, let&rsquo;s talk about what is artificial&nbsp;intelligence&nbsp;(AI)?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Artificial Intelligence aka AI is simply the intelligence that is instilled in the machinery. So much so is the power of this AI is that machines work like a human capable of interpreting, comprehend, store and even remember the information for the future to modify its functionality. Few key reasons for its popularity being:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> It allows, accuracy, precision, and chances of error become bleak, hence greater efficiency.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Better Insights:</strong> As its analysis of data is more deep, the insights it produces are more helpful.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Equipped with Smart Tools:</strong> The whole process run on algorithms that are then backed by tools like Voice Assistants, GPS trackers etc are few to name.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Comfortable and Progressive when comes to adapting or learning new algorithm patterns.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWith these super-efficient and effective qualities, AI is revolutionalizing many industries and changing the way they once worked. A few of them which are benefitting a lot from it is banking, medical and last but not the least, marketing.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>After a brief discussion on the concept of Artificial Intelligence, it&rsquo;s time to move onto the effects it has on the Industry of Marketing.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Marketing a product is all about knowing your consumer, catering to their needs and then keep improvising and checking on the same strategy as per the response you receive from the consumers. But the toughest challenge is to break the needs of consumers so simplistically that you are in a better position to formulate strategies as per that intel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEarlier, obtaining such information wasn&rsquo;t a piece of cake, and huge surveys were involved to derive the market positioning of a brand. But AI came as a buffer which helped this gap and lengthy procedure to be out of the circle and intelligence took over the charge.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AI got it all, from the power of analysis to a data unfathomable for humans to process the data to adapt to that data for further use. It is basically acting human in analyzing market trends but on a larger scale and spectrum. The efficiency AI brings to the table is the reason why industries are actively opting for it.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The advantages of having an AI (Artificial Intelligence) are as follows:</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Know your audience better:</strong> With an in-depth analysis of strategies and consumer behavior on it, the results are pretty accurate and precise to consider and work upon. The dynamic behavior of the consumer has been the problem that AI seamlessly dealt with being all intelligence, algorithms, and technology which matched the dynamic nature of the human as well.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Enhanced User experience:</strong> What do you like the most? Well, chances are your search engines knows better than you for that matter of fact. How is that possible? Artificial intelligence. This similar data is then utilized by different relevant peers who on the basis of this, strategize on different products and services. Isn&rsquo;t it amazing? It simply helps you cater to what your audience actually looking for.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Strong threshold over Marketing:</strong> You don&rsquo;t need to anymore anticipate your audience and their behavior. AI helps to get you what the demographics are so that your focus goes more on formulating and implementation of a strategy rather than research. It takes off the burden of research which earlier fell heavily on the part of marketing.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Stirs productivity:</strong> The number of repeated tasks and process, or even lengthy tasks, from keeping track of the algorithm to consumer dynamic behavior, it deals with all of it, increasing the productivity which was costing you both time and money, but now with AI you made the process effective and productive.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>ROI (Return of Investment):</strong> With all the perks, and with increasing technology, probably more are going to be added to the list, AI is rendering more than it is taking. The accuracy, consumer satisfaction, and overall productivity it enhances lead to better returns on investment i.e. ROI which is the goal for any business.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Even after stating all the facts, you have a second thought, let&rsquo;s talk about the numbers. <strong>Statistics from the consumer point of view say that 38% of them believe that if AI is sure to enhance the consumer experience and 73% of them are actually open to the purchase of such businesses who are using AI</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAt the end of the day, your consumer is what decides your market and they are amped up by the advent of AI in the realm of business. All the more reason to have AI integrated with your brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><br />\r\nNow that we have discussed the advantages, how one implements AI when comes to Digital Marketing.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>AI is changing the way you are interacting with your consumers. The engagement which one derives through AI like traffic, likes, following, post engagement, awareness and so on, is nothing like how we once thought of marketing to produce, but bigger and better with acquiring and retaining consumers at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Chatbots</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>From Google Assistant to Siri to Alexa, all are your virtual assistants through voice recognition. They are used to enhance the user experience and help your consumers have an interactive query solving portal to go to every time they are in need.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Product Recommendation and Advanced Shopping Experience</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You always have seen your online shopping forum having suggestions for which actually are extensions and prompts made on the preferences you have already searched or bought. This enhances your experience in a way where you are updated about the trends which reflect your choice by the AI your online forum is using. A consumer would like you to have such a platform that understands their needs and aspirations and engage with them while they make a choice. It is a secret friend everyone needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>A Great Tool for Advertising</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>For any campaign to work out, the strategy entailing the target audience and their demographics play an important part in making the campaign successful. Therefore, having AI backing up your campaign is effective with the research and ease of data you require to even formulate a strategy that is holistic and streamlined.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>AI-enabled Websites</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Now AI is entering the realm of website building making the process easier than usual for the website builders when it comes to creating landing pages and other AI-related processes like Chatbots which are now preferred in every website if you carefully have a look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AI changing the way we once assumed digital space would, making it more engaging, easier and effective when it comes to either side of it, consumers or businesses.

(27, 1, 1, 'Let`s Blog: A Blog', 'let`s-blog-a-blog', '<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s talk about writing a blog while writing a blog, got the irony here?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enough messing around, let&rsquo;s know about how to actually write a blog which is crisp, readable and appealing to your readers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We understand that writing a blog could be tedious, from picking a topic, to research and finally penning down the thoughts, the process could be quite lengthy and tiresome.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over that, the pressure of writing a blog that actually reaches your audience in true sense is also a worry which shadows you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see how can the whole rendezvous be both fun and enriching for you and your readers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But first, we should know a little bit about how and why you need blogging for your business before actually delving into how it is to be written.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Problem solvers aka Saviours</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>No one accidentally lands up on your blog, to be honest. It is a sweet game of visitor on a lookout for the information with keywords on their search engine and you, having that information. Your blogs aren&rsquo;t going in vain, whatsoever. People out there are in due need of that information which you are circulating, that is why you are writing about it and several other portals as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SEO: Search Engine Optimization</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>That SEO of your needs solid blogging to back you up when all you aspire for is higher search ranking. Your right use of keywords along with informative content can bring a lot of traffic to your website and push your ranking high up in the SEO game. But pressure always isn&rsquo;t to have all the keywords used cumbersomely but effectively so that the intent of the blog along with the SEO of the website, all could be maintained.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Comprehensive&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Information is the inception of any blog but too much information can put your reader off and they leave the blog half-read. You don&rsquo;t want that, definitely not. Here as well, just like in SEO, you have to strike a balance between in-depth information and keep the interest of your reader balanced. If information is too much, it can bore the reader who is usually there to know about the topic with no prior knowledge. If the fun quotient is too much, then the reader who seeks serious information from your blog will leave unsatisfied. Hence, strike a balance!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Now comes the tough part, WRITING THAT BLOG!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It could be overwhelming having to look at the blank screen and to think from where and how to start that blog. You could have the information and WiFi with full speed but that cursor blinking infinitely could be daunting. The idea is to just not be backed with information but the execution of it as well. Therefore, an outline is needed to break the jinx of that blank sheet in front of you. An outline will:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Take the edge off (Of course)</li>\r\n	<li>Makes you more organized when coming to the information</li>\r\n	<li>Channels your thought process</li>\r\n	<li>Doesn&rsquo;t overwhelm you during the process</li>\r\n	<li>A streamlined approach always work</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\nBut how to actually pick a format? Let&rsquo;s find out!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are always a few typical, go-to blogs you will find over the internet, but have you ever been observational enough to understand the pattern they are following? Yes/No? Whatever your answer, regardless, let&rsquo;s see what you have or haven&rsquo;t missed while crawling through these blog formats.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The most common kind is &ldquo;Listicles&rdquo;. For e.g. 5 tips or 10 reasons why you will find plenty of them crowding the internet. They are called listicles for the very reason that they are information provided in the form of a list.</li>\r\n	<li>Then comes the &ldquo;How-to blogs&rdquo; which like the name says talk about how to deal with a certain issue while both explaining the issue and the solution for the same.</li>\r\n	<li>Last, but not least, come to the Q&amp;A based blogs where in a question is what is the heading of the blog and later in the blog, the question is answered.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Meanwhile, we have delved into the formats, let&rsquo;s go a little deeper and other important aspects of a blog one must focus on while writing one.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Headlines with a Punch</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Headlines are a doorway to your blog, hence it is needed that they are catchy enough to gauge the reader&rsquo;s attention so that they are compelled to look through the blog to actually see what is there inside.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As per the statistics, 60% of people shared the blogs with catchy headlines, even without reading the blog, but the headline was so self-explanatory that they couldn&rsquo;t stop themselves, as that mirrored exactly what is there inside the blog which they find worth sharing. You create the first impression with the blog&rsquo;s headline even before the reader could decide whether they have to read the blog or have any opinion about it as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Proofread your content</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>It is very important how you are presenting your content in front of your reader. You don&rsquo;t want the reader to have this perception that you were not through with what you presented them with because that will create a lack of trust on the content you are showcasing, along with that there is a sense of unpleasantly which gets attached with the content as well, which turns off the reader. Spell check, grammar check, alignment along with that adequate para breaks are also necessary to have a presentable look for your content.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>The blog should be &ldquo;Scroll-Friendly&rdquo;</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A nice blog is also the ones that tip the reader off to other paras seamlessly without even making an effort, but the effort has definitely made but on a very subtle note. It is done smartly yet consciously to make the reader go all to the end of the blog and if not read entirely, but spend more time than expected. It could be making the paras smaller, adding more subtexts and subheading while breaking the humongous information into readable and delightful pieces, which gives ease of action and flow in the way your blog is read.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>SEO yet again</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>An old telltale where the content got jeopardized because of poor SEO. Therefore, you must first have a thorough keyword check before you can actually start writing your blog so that beforehand only you narrow them down and decide what mix of keywords are not only suitable for the blog but also for the SEO at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blogging is worth your time even if it is tiring or lengthy when comes to being a process. It is that one service you don&rsquo;t charge your visitor, it is a VAS information you add to your website so that your reader gets to know you as a business, and also the product and the queries which revolve around it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe website traffic it generates helps you with not only leads but conversions as well. It is an invaluable skill to know how to blog because whichever business you wish to take online, it&rsquo;s ranking is boasted only because of the blogs you feature and market through SEO, which is a free service, for your information. Therefore, it is necessary to make the process interesting for yourself while writing a blog keeping in mind all the good things it will bring to you and your reader.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.doorsstudio.com/\">By Doors Studio</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.doorsstudio.com/content-writing.php\">Learn more about writing</a><br />\r\n&nbsp;</h3>', '1587720699.jpg', '1587720699.jpg', 'Let`s Blog: A Blog - Doors Studio', 'Read Doors studio blog about how to write a blog and how to to write an effective blog, where you can able to engage your users.', 'Let`s Blog: A Blog', 'active', '2019-10-05 09:33:21', '2020-04-24 04:03:19'),
(28, 1, 1, 'A Complete Failure: Paid Followers, Likes or Comments', 'a-complete-failure-paid-followers,-likes-or-comments', '<p>What fake thing you ever appreciated? Nor friends, lover, or even brands you wear, you prefer the original, rather than fake.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut social media has turned into a pretense which is heavily depended upon how popular you&rsquo;re as a brand or even as a content creator.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor this, people are now turning to buy their way out to reach that social media validation of having more likes, followers or comments.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowers are the top things amongst others that are constantly being bought to cope up with a FOMO (fear of missing out) which is now hovering over everybody&rsquo;s mind as criteria of success.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is understandable that social media could be boring and dull when initially you make a presence, especially for brands, whose aim is not only popularity but business as well out from that platform.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut in any case, be a content creator or brand, paid anything from Followers to Comments is just a social media spoof and can never benefit your social media presence,<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Let&rsquo;s break this down fact by fact, why it is a bad idea to buy followers!</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The Reasons why you shouldn&rsquo;t buy followers are as follows:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>They are not your Target Audience</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us assume that the brand you are working manufacture a product which is for Women. Your obvious target audience would be women but in that too, you will target specific age and income group and rest are prospective buyers since they can be an acquaintance of such women but are not a direct consumer of that product. You would want such an audience to be on your social media platform as well who would be updated about the product and content which you will create would be relevant to them as well. But buying followers, even if they are real, exposes you to an audience which is not yours in the first place and having them is useless and a bad investment altogether.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Decline in Engagement</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>No longer having a presence on social media is static or monotonous. Now every day, there is a new trend which is if not kept in sync with, your social media can sink in and have poor presence which can lead you to become obsolete. Engagement is one medium through which you ensure that your social media reach is not for a toss and is actually turning out well for you. But having fake followers or bought followers is completely bad for the health of your social media. As said, they are not you &lsquo;followers&rsquo;, hence having them is equally useless because they won&rsquo;t interested in your content at all and that will lead to having no engagement from their side on your platform. What could be worse is that if they are fake accounts, they won&rsquo;t be valid at all as followers. Poor engagement can affect the algorithm and hamper the overall reach. The social media presence which you actually aimed at building got submerged just like that.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Paid Advertisements go for a toss</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Why you invest in Paid Marketing? It is a more surgical approach to target &ldquo;Your Audience&rdquo; so that they get to see what you are doing and you get a chance to market what you think are your hotcakes to the consumer who is in need of those products. But the calculations here go haywire because your ads are now not only seen by your audience but also the fake followers/audience which is either not interested or they are bots. Your money is wasted twice this way. One when you bought that fake following and now when you are investing in ad campaigns which are not actually reaching the kind of audience you are hoping to target.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Potential Spammer</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember having spammers? Well, a bunch of them could be from your fake follower&#39;s list as well. They have a access to see who all you&rsquo;re following and can create havoc for you by either spamming your account with irrelevant comments and opinions and can directly go to your follower&#39;s profiles and spam them with content, ads, comments, and messages they don&rsquo;t want to have in the first place. It creates distrust in the minds of your audience and to simply put, breach of privacy and is very annoying.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>A major crack in your reputation</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>It is at the end of the day fraudulent practice to have followers who are not real. You are deceiving your consumer both potential and existing by showing a fake image of your brand being popular over social media. This is even more dangerous if you&rsquo;re a content creator because this means that as an influencer or an artist if suppose, you&rsquo;re creating a picture and position of yourself in the market which isn&rsquo;t true at all. All the above points as well, especially bot followers bothering your existing clientele or audience is another issue because as a brand you&rsquo;re a nuisance or a threat to people who follow you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>All this sums up to just one thing that buying followers is a facade rather than a pro in any sense. In longer run, it breaks your reputation down in the very market you were trying to create a mark on.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo what should one do if not this to create a reputation?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Have an interactive platform</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Engage with your audience. Whatever amount of it you have. By interaction, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they commenting and you obliging with a &lsquo;thank you!&rsquo; but to actually going to their profiles as well, and appreciating the content they create.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Promote the platforms you&rsquo;re on</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social media is about having a presence first and then talking about it time and again on all social media, you are on. You have to link all your social media platforms together and build a network and keep making your following aware of what all you are doing across all those platforms. This is what you can do online. Your website is one place where you can mention all your social media links as well. Then come to your visiting cards, pamphlets and even social media creatives where at the bottom you can mention all these platforms by an icon and through the course of time, people will start picking up on these mentions and the traffic will go to other platforms beside on the one you are mentioning it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Buy ads!!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paid promotion is far better than the paid following. But rather than leading people to like your page, show them your service, work, or product. Be a seller and be aggressive. Showcase your work to get or attract your audience. But bar from buying the followers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Contest your way out!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>People love to win and especially if a challenge is there and with that a price they would like to earn out it. Free products, vouchers or anything else which your brand can offer but must be related to your brand because otherwise, it doesn&rsquo;t solve the purpose of you hosting a contest. You can boost such contests by promoting them through paid marketing, along with that it brings tractions through tactics like &ldquo; tagging other people&rdquo;, &ldquo;using the hashtag&rdquo; and other such means to bring reach to the social media presence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investing your money in social media is a decision to be taken wisely.

You are expected to maintain a feed, a social life, and varied interests just to be trendy and &lsquo;relevant&rsquo; enough for the platform. This is leading to an environment that leads absolutely no space and scope for you being real on the platform.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though you can be if you are not much affected about what goes on there but let&rsquo;s face it, we are also so much consumed by the trends and effort to follow them that it gets unnerving to not give much thought about all this, peer-pressure can do that to you. But there must be a way out from all this, isn&rsquo;t it? Well, there is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While going through a light-hearted blog on Hubspot, we came across this term- FINSTA. It is an acronym for the full form, FAKE INSTAGRAM. At the sight of it, you will feel that it isn&rsquo;t just against the motion of being more real over. Don&rsquo;t judge this book by its cover, now will you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everything aside, what is FINSTA? Well, it is about creating a real account, with real followers, just when it comes to the content, the whole thing gets real. Why it is called fake, for the reason being it goes against the conventional form of Instagram feed, wherein a person feels at ease and free enough to share and express the real side of their life. Here the pressure of being on-fleek is absolutely null and you can be goofy, sarcastic and totally unfiltered about yourself and your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But then again, you have to picky about who you want in this group and not. You can maintain an ideal Instagram life elsewhere where different strangers, your not so close friend, colleagues, distinct relatives and everyone you don&rsquo;t want to show your real side, and prefer them knowing you through a certain filter, this ain&rsquo;t a bad idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The catch is, this account must be not that popular and you have to keep it private as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been a lot of changes on the platforms although. Instagram is soon to do away with the number of likes and it has recently also removed the activity tab where in your activity was earlier open to anyone and everyone if your profile is public and only to your friends if it was a private account, but the catch was you have to follow this person first to know about their moves. This might change the fundamental things like the need to have a maximum number of likes or certain number of followers, but the validation and acceptance you get for having a certain style in your feed still prevails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This account could like that slam book where your friends and you together could be whoever you actually are and can be any level of crazy, without people having an opinion and you weighed down with any such thing as to be a Perfect Instagram Human Being. Until we can have space where being ordinary is accepted, FINSTA could your option to be you and real over social media.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy <a href=\"https://www.doorsstudio.com\">Doors Studio</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.doorsstudio.com/social-media-marketing.php\">Read more about Social media marketing &amp; Strategy</a></p>', '1587720979.jpg', '1587720979.jpg', 'It`s time to get real with FINSTA! - Doors Studio', 'Read here Doors Studio Blog - Itâ€™s time to get real with FINSTA!', 'It`s time to get real with FINSTA!', 'active', '2019-10-18 08:19:53', '2020-04-24 04:06:19');

And if you are working for an agency, then it is never just one brand you are working on, there are multiple verticals and accounts you are handling at the same time. It is like pumping new and fresh content every day without fail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There comes a point you go dead on ideas and conceptualizing anymore seems difficult and lethargic. You are no more in a position to form a strategy that is groundbreaking and is a disruption in the market. Mediocre content won&rsquo;t work and you are very well aware of posting a below-average content. Your image and your brand&rsquo;s image is at stake if the content isn&rsquo;t how you promised them when you pitched up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be honest, a very dramatic scene of climax here, but like the hero you&rsquo;re, there are surely ways in which this whole &ldquo;content block&rdquo; could be averted with these very hacks you already knew about but were not able to integrate it as well or might not as well be thoroughly aware of it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NO STRESS OR SWEAT whatsoever. We got you covered!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea is to keep broader categories under which content could be created throughout the social media calendar, hence they need to be identified before you start your brand&rsquo;s social media. If you have already started then, these points might help you reflect and structure your social media under this broader framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Art of Social Media Calendar</strong><br />\r\nBefore going into the ideas, let&rsquo;s know how important social media calendars are. They help you have:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A timeline</li>\r\n	<li>Anticipate your move beforehand</li>\r\n	<li>Gives you more time to create content</li>\r\n	<li>You don&rsquo;t miss the important days and events</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So, you must spend time on creating one to have a seamless year.</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Take a hint from Netflix, &lsquo;Make Series&rsquo;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Series are best.</strong> To be more descriptive than that, series allows your audience to become interactive and hooked, and you as a content creator get more scope of content creation from a single topic. You can make them on a weekly or monthly basis and can see the conversation around your brand increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter is the easiest space to create such a series. You just need to come up with a hashtag and conversation is carried forward by the people themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bribe them! Just kidding, host a Contest or a Giveaway</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding free to anything gives an instant motivation to the otherwise silent followers of your brand. It also adds to the chance of inviting newer traffic to your brand. This build-up excitement and allow you to leverage on with the engagement which follows when you post such content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It becomes an instant hit when it is related to your brand and the services/product your brand deals in.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is data by Tailwind, as quoted by Sprout Social that 91% of posts you see on Instagram which are able to fetch around 1000 plus likes are able to do so through these contests and giveaways. When it comes to growth, 70% of accounts that show steady and remarkable growth are the ones who regularly hosted them on their portal in comparison to the ones which didn&rsquo;t do them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You necessarily don&rsquo;t have to collaborate with the other brands to host a successful giveaway.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Follow the guidelines below and you will the perfect mix for your next giveaway!</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;<strong>Freebie:</strong> Thumb-rule is to have a prize which from your brand or least, should be highly relevant and related. You can though give them anything, but that won&rsquo;t translate into a long-term association from your follower&rsquo;s end and will only bring irrelevant traffic who will be randomly just seeking those freebies not your brand, hence, a big no-no.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>&nbsp;Well-defined Rules:</strong> Rules allow a format to your giveaway. Social Media is informal in its approach, hence you need to give certain guidelines to your followers to follow to enter and win the contest. E.g a certain hashtag, they need to tag you and so on, so that even if you encounter spammers or insincere applicants, you already have a rulebook to refer to.</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;<strong>Assign a POC:</strong> be careful that in case of any queries or inquiries, your followers must have a POC to fall back on. Be it a contact number or email, anything from these two should be there for your potential applicants to contact when it is related to your giveaway/contest.</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;<strong>Challenge your audience with a Twist:</strong> ask a question around your brand, a fact, a historical event, or anything that makes them think adds value to your brand. A senseless giveaway without adding anything to your brand awareness is baseless because that is the whole purpose behind that!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bring in a famous face- Social Media Takeovers:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are so many stakeholders and people who are associated with your brand and have a say as to what they feel about you as a brand. They are doing so on their well-established social media platforms already and channeling them from there to your own social media could be a smart move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, these takeovers last for 24 hours. While at it, you get new views on follower&rsquo;s side and your existing follower get to see someone new and your brand is also projected through a different lens.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Curate your feed, Repost-Retweet-Regran!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is the news flash! You can absolutely get inspired, that isn&rsquo;t plagiarism. Same way, you can pick up content from other accounts and repost on your social media platform. It is called content-curation and is quite different from content-creation. Here, you pick an existing content that is relevant to your brand or is talking about your brand and you post it on your brand&rsquo;s social media. Easy! This could include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Product reviews</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Customer service reviews</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Influencer&rsquo;s aesthetic post</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Any insight by a peer on the brand</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You have an abundance of content around you, you need to just sit down and write it all down at once place and see how you never run out of content ever again. The idea is to be highly observant of the environment around your brand and also what your competitors are doing so that you could be a step ahead from them when it comes to either integrating a trend or rather creating a new one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>By <a href=\"https://www.doorsstudio.com/social-media-marketing.php\">Doors Studio - Social Media Agency</a></h3>', '1587721018.jpg', '1587721018.jpg', 'How to keep your social media safe from going stagnant?', 'Doors Studio Blog - Learn more about How to keep your social media safe from going stagnant?', 'How to keep your social media safe from going stagnant?', 'active', '2019-12-06 11:36:31', '2020-04-24 04:06:58'),

With the help of other words in the search engine, the machine would be able to locate the pages which will give more useful information or answers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs of now, BERT will be applied on search engines but it will also have a similar effect on the Google Assistant as well where many people rely on it for their day-to-day or general activities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHence, a search result change will reflect the new understanding of the query using BERT making the searching more smooth and seamless.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>EXAMPLES OF BERT APPLICATION</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The BERT Application has improved the results of the google search in the following examples (please refer to neilpatel blog:)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.&nbsp; If one types: 2019 brazil traveller to the USA need a visa&quot;.<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.doorsstudio.com/admin/media/files/uploadimages/images/Untitled11.png\" style=\"height:349px; width:628px\" /></strong><br />\r\nBefore Bert, the top result would be how US citizens can travel to Brazil without a visa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut one has to note the difference in the search results where previously it showed how US citizens can travel to Brazil but now with BERT application, it showed the legal ways and means through which Brazilian citizens can travel to the USA. The results therefore now turn out to be more relevant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe search was not about US people going to Brazil, it was about people from Brazil travelling to the US.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThus, Google is now taking into account prepositions like &ldquo;for&rdquo; or &ldquo;to&rdquo; that can have multiple meanings to the search query.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>2.&nbsp; If one types: &ldquo;math practice books for adults&rdquo;</strong><br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.doorsstudio.com/admin/media/files/uploadimages/images/Untitled22.png\" style=\"height:315px; width:628px\" /><br />\r\n&nbsp;One can see the difference in the google searches before and after.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEarlier, the google search would show results of maths books that an adult can study and therefore showed the maths books of classes 6 to 8.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, now with BERT application, it will now share results that will help and assist adults in doing maths and revising it as well.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>COMPARING BERT WITH RANKBRAIN</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>BERT is the most significant update of the Google Search till date since the development of RankBrain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, it is necessary to first understand the difference between RankBrain and BERT.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey are two separate algorithms that may be used to modify search results.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRankBrain refers to the machine-learning artificial intelligence which functions in processing the search results on Google.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is part of Google&rsquo;s overall search algorithm, where it sorts through the billions of pages of a search and presents with the most relevant pages to the user.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RankBrain adjusts results by looking at the current query and finding similar past queries of the word in the search engine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen, it reviews the performance of the search results for those historic queries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the basis of what it can view, RankBrain adjusts the output of the results of the normal organic search ranking algorithms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other function of RankBrain is to refine the google searches in an aim to provide more accurate results as well as it figures out the pattern between unconnected searches and tries out to find out similarities between them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet&rsquo;s take an example to understand this better. If we search, &ldquo;birth date of Abhijeet Banerjee&rsquo;s wife&rdquo;(the Nobel Prize winner in Economics), it would straightaway give the result of Abhijeet Banerjee&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s birth date, her name as well as people connected to her.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBoth BERT and RankBrain are applied by Google to process queries and web page content in order to gauge a better understanding of what the words intend to mean.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBERT has not been developed to replace RankBrain. Google has the liberty to utilize multiple methods to understand a query. In other words, it means that BERT could be applied on its own, in parallel with the functioning of other Google Algorithms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>HOW IS CONTENT MARKETING IMPACTED BY BERT</strong><br />\r\nConnecting BERT with content marketing, there is no way of fully optimizing this application as such.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, Google has advised writing a meaningful and valuable content with clarity for the users that satisfies their search intent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince BERT has been designed to interpret that intent, it makes sense to give the user what they wish to know from Google.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe role of content writers or blog writers or any professional who is working on the internet comes now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a writer, one has to write in a competitive spirit as many people are penning down on the same or similar topics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn terms of content ranking, one has to ensure to write very specific so that the write-up or the blog answers the question to the point.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHence, the crux of the matter for SEOs and content creators is that they focus on writing great and substantial content for people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow if one wants to climb up the ladder of competitive rankings, a simple solution would be to keep one&rsquo;s content distinctive and stand out from the crowded information.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThus, It is more about answering a user&rsquo;s question as quick as possible and providing as much value compared to the competition and helps in getting traffic which gets converted into the conversion of metrics and bounce rates.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThus, one can see how the new changes brought about in this BERT algorithm has updated Google making it much more relevant and advanced for searchers and thus creates a better and improved experience for everyone across all ages who is using the Google platform.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.doorsstudio.com/\">BY - Digital marketing agency and Creative Agency</a></p>', '1587721064.jpg', '1587721064.jpg', 'The BERT Algorithm in Google Search - How it affects search system? - Doors Studio', 'Read Doors Studio blog to learn more about The BERT Algorithm in Google Search - How it affects search system?', 'The BERT Algorithm in Google Search - How It Affects Search System?', 'active', '2020-01-23 12:42:49', '2020-04-24 04:07:44'),
(32, 1, 1, 'HOW TO MAKE DIGITAL MARKETING SUCCESSFUL IN UAE?', 'how-to-make-digital-marketing-successful-in-uae', '<p>Digital marketing today has become one of the important modes of marketing. It has replaced the old ways of in-house marketing where the company took the initiative on its own to promote and market their products or services.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the internet continues to thrive amongst the masses, now more are getting glued to the screens of their mobiles, TVs, tablets and other digital mediums. As people rely more on the online medium for everything, similarly for purchasing products and services also, people prefer to do it online.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, the task of the company now becomes to appoint a digital marketing firm that will work upon the exact requirement of the company and make strategies to attain the digital marketing presence that it needs. But before one chooses a good digital marketing agency, one needs to ask oneself the following three questions about the company:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong><em>What is it that you want to market - a product, service or company in general or a mix of all? This should be clear in your mind before even approaching the agency.</em></strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong><em>What are the objectives that the company wants to achieve through the digital marketing platform?</em></strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong><em>Third, in what way you want to endorse the business - is it a social media campaign, an ad campaign or something else through which one wants one&rsquo;s business to gain a prominent presence.</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt is therefore imperative on the part of the companies to promote and market themselves online in such a way that amongst the chaos of information, the marketing promotions need to stand out and catch the attention of the viewers and subsequently of the potential consumers as well.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>HOW TO CHOOSE THE MOST SUITABLE DIGITAL MARKETING AGENCY</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Agency should provide the expected service</strong> - It is necessary to cross-check that the services that one needs are being provided by the agency. Some key points should, however, should be kept in mind:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Differentiate what can be done in-house and what can be outsourced. It is important to know what communication skills is the in-house marketing team are good at and then allocate the services to the agency to impart their marketing services</li>\r\n	<li>To choose a digital marketing agency that caters to the exact objectives that one is looking for through digital marketing such as attracting the traffic of a certain crowd online, creating brand awareness, creating leads and converting them into effective customers.</li>\r\n	<li>To choose what kind of agency one should hire - an experienced company with an excellent portfolio or a relatively young company with a good portfolio. It all boils down to a variety of ideas that will attract you to go ahead with them.</li>\r\n	<li>To state the budget in which you would like to work with so that there is no confusion in the future regarding the expenses.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do a thorough research of the Agency</strong> - Research about the agency from the overall perspective where one needs to analyze how they meet their targets by keeping the following points in mind:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Go through their portfolio to know about the kind of work they have been indulged in, which gives an idea of the quality of work done by them.</li>\r\n	<li>How effectively and efficiently does the agency complete their work</li>\r\n	<li>Check the reviews of the agency through rankings done by companies and other sites especially by the customers. The most important thing to see is how they have improved on their last work.</li>\r\n	<li>One way of getting an idea of their work is to go through their website, blogs, and write-ups and see what attracts a person to their work online. Ultimately one&rsquo;s company&rsquo;s website will also be the face of one&rsquo;s business.</li>\r\n	<li>Analyze the agency&rsquo;s and their competitor&rsquo;s work and see what unique work they have done and which agency&rsquo;s work is more attractive and distinctive. Also, analyze what is the specialty of the agency.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Ask for &lsquo;Request For Purpose&rsquo; (RFP)</strong> - This is the next step after one has chosen one&rsquo;s right company. One would have to ask them to send the Request For Purpose. One now has to share all the details as to what one&rsquo;s company is all about. In addition to that, one also has to share the objectives that one wants to achieve to get one&rsquo;s business as well as expand one&rsquo;s business. However, it is also important to keep in mind that one needs to have a realistic future plan and scope for one&rsquo;s business. One&rsquo;s RFP should include the following points:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A summary of one&rsquo;s business, its current position, background, and past work and achievements</li>\r\n	<li>The company&rsquo;s requirement</li>\r\n	<li>Company&rsquo;s Objectives including Return On Investment (ROI)</li>\r\n	<li>One&rsquo;s Target Audience</li>\r\n	<li>Budget framework</li>\r\n	<li>Timelines within which the work has to be delivered</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>WHY UAE?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>UAE is a major hub of industries and companies which have continuously been booming. The market has the amazing ability to attract people across countries, demographics, fields of work and varied interests. &nbsp;Work culture has been thriving in this place and so is the work culture. It has become a prominent work destination for several people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UAE serves as a potential place where both the company as well as the agency can expand their own business and work. Both sides can use their expertise to achieve their goals. Over time, it has become affluent with a massively vast range of industries, products, and services including technology adaptation and integration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the company&rsquo;s perspective, there is a good target audience to whom they can cater to and do business. There has been a lot of diversity amongst the people in the UAE, especially when it comes to foreign diaspora. Work opportunities and business opportunities are immense as the population in the UAE is expanding and various needs and requirements are coming up that in turn lead to availing a variety of products and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saying this, it becomes very significant for digital marketing agencies as well in the UAE to use the opportunity to interact and engage with these different businesses and companies to help them expand and get recognized as a brand. It is the quality of work done by the agency that builds a strong brand voice for that particular company and hence separates that company from its competitors. This finally leads to successful digital marketing pursuits.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>HOW DO DIGITAL MARKETING AGENCIES WORK IN UAE?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Several features of marketing strategy are the same everywhere across the globe when it comes to building a brand and marketing, however, in UAE things work a bit differently. Therefore, digital marketing agencies should know the actual situation in which they need to work and how are the UAE clients different from the rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In the UAE, it is important to be different and focus on the following in order to stand out:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Building a relationship based on trust</li>\r\n	<li>In sync and credible with culture</li>\r\n	<li>Customized products and services along with unique customer journey and experience</li>\r\n	<li>Reviewing the customer experience to measure the success of the brand and further empower the brand</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>HOW DO DIGITAL MARKETING AGENCIES WORK DIFFERENTLY IN UAE?</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>When Visuals Impress:</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Quality creative visuals are always a big thumbs up and catch a lot of eyeballs. With 8-9 million people in UAE being active social media as well as internet users, content can become viral if the strategies are used properly and targeted to the right audience. This leads to the constructive integration of virtual branding online and the real branding of the company offline.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Trust Builds Reputation:</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Selling should not be the sole objective. People in the UAE do give importance to the relationship building with a product or a service that leads to trust-building and customer relationships. Nothing can be more satisfying when the same people come back to use the product and service again and moreover associate themselves with the brands.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Ensuring Unique Customer Experience :</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>UAE market is serious when it comes to how a particular product or service affects the customers. Apart from the customization and personalization of products and services, it is also crucial to engage with brands by customers even after the usage is over. People should remember the brand forever and moreover, keep using this brand continuously. Thus, a positive customer association has to be promoted through digital marketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Discipline and Ethical Marketing :</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>When marketing strategies are being followed, one should be aware that producing any false information or numbers should not be done at all. It is better to go slow and steady for brand integration than to ruin the brand image with the impatient and fast goal of building the brand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Customer Analysis :</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Before one proceeds for digital marketing and brand making, one has to take efforts to understand the customer base in order to know their preferences, choices, likes and dislikes and certainly the current trend. The company should be projected and marketed in such a way that it understands every customer individually by giving better options or replacements or even more personalized shopping.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Catering to Luxury :</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>UAE is a place comprising of mostly culturally and financially rich people.There is an elite class that believes in indulging with brand irrespective of the price. However, in order to reach out to this particular section of people, it is necessary to connect and engage with the premium target audience where they undergo unique experience instead of creating deals, offers or discounts. The premium audience should be able to resonate and identify with the brand. They should have the pride of being associated with the brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Respect the Traditional Moral and Value System :</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>It should be kept in mind that when being highly creative to attract people&rsquo;s attention, one should not forget to be in limits while expressing one&rsquo;s creativity. In other words, do not advertise or market any product or service in such a way that ends up hurting anyone&rsquo;s feelings, beliefs, and sentiments. One should always respect the rules followed by a community of any region in UAE.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThus, in this way, both the company as well as digital marketing agency can work in sync successfully when it comes to catering to the UAE market.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDigital marketing has now become a core part of reaching out to targeted customers where marketing and advertising have to be not only personalized and relevant but attract more new customers to buy and engage with the brand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, digital marketing agencies both based in UAE and in other countries can be productive and successful as long as they can work in a systematic manner adhering to the cultural and business rules of UAE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.doorsstudio.com/digital-marketing.php\"><strong>By Doors Studio - Digital Marketing Agency&nbsp;with Proven Results</strong></a></p>', '1587721105.jpg', '1587721105.jpg', 'HOW TO MAKE DIGITAL MARKETING SUCCESSFUL IN UAE? - Doors Studio', 'Read Doors studio blog and learn more about - how to make digital marketing successful in UAE?', 'HOW TO MAKE DIGITAL MARKETING SUCCESSFUL IN UAE?', 'active', '2020-01-27 13:08:26', '2020-04-24 04:08:25'),

If one chooses one&rsquo;s own picture, then one should be sure enough that he or she is has a strong personal brand image. From a technical standpoint, one needs to ensure the display picture is of high quality and attractive. The username is one of the most important first steps in opening an Instagram account for one&rsquo;s business which will define the brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Choose the type of business activity</strong> - If one has selected to set-up a business username on Instagram, then one should be sure to set-up a business profile. Though this is basic, nevertheless it is equally important to let the target audience to have clarity about what kind of activities or services or products does one&rsquo;s brand deal with. So, if it is a clothing brand, then it should be stated explicitly in order to garner the attention of genuine and potential clients and customers. Using a profile tracking link in your Instagram account profile can help further discover data and insights into your audience. When switching to a business account, one will get access to a number of free features. These extra features are integral in helping grow one&rsquo;s account quickly. These extra features include statistics and data on your followers too.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Choose your words carefully</strong> - Do not get anyone confused by keeping two different names, that is one different username and another different Instagram name. People will search for a brand by typing the person&rsquo;s name or company&rsquo;s name. Also, try to keep keywords as well where putting a keyword in the name will triple one&rsquo;s searchability scores. The keywords should be chosen in such a way that it brings potential followers where they will search by using hashtags or specific locations. To illustrate, if one wants to attract a target audience based in Delhi, then the word &ldquo;Delhi&rdquo; will come next to one&rsquo;s name. Hashtags are also the bread and butter of Instagram. Hashtags are the main ways that users who do not follow one&rsquo;s account will find be able to find either by searching for topics in the search bar or by clicking the tag on another user&#39;s post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Instagram is the first and the last impression</strong> - In Instagram&rsquo;s bio, be to the point and precise. One needs to be crisp of what one is doing and promoting or at which location one is based in. It is important to take advantage of Instagram&rsquo;s feature that enables us to add hashtags and profile links in one&rsquo;s bio. This is the best way to promote a branded hashtag. The keywords need to reflect one&rsquo;s strongest skills or interests that one wants to highlight on the account. In order to stand apart from other Instagram accounts, it is significant to go through similar accounts and make one&rsquo;s account unique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Add personality to the bio</strong> - After covering the fundamentals of Instagram bio content, it is crucial to add some life to the bio which makes it easier for people to understand the meaning and vision of the Instagram profile at once. This can be done through various ways such as a beautiful or a funny quote or an emoji or just a random thought in a custom font that in the end express the essence of one&rsquo;s business activity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Make a statement</strong> - Being unique on Instagram should be complemented with making a statement. This proves to be an innovative method of showcasing creativity with respect to one&rsquo;s brand. One way of doing this is by creating a multi-grid collage that forms a comprehensible image. Overall, this adds to the style of the framework of the Instagram profile.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Keep the communication strong</strong> - Do not just make an Instagram profile and make posts or stories and leave it. One has an account on it in order to engage with all kinds of audiences and not just let the brand account be rigid. It is important to build a relationship with customers and potential customers. This kind of engagement promotes trust and positive feedback. By communicating more, one can ensure the brand does not remain static and hence build a rapport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Develop a social media calenda</strong>r - This is one of the salient features of digital marketing where it is essential to have a social media calendar. This will ensure that the Instagram account is constantly active and is being promoted with an agenda that defines the mission and vision of your brand. Do not let the account become a dormant one and have sporadic posts or stories. This breaks the flow of marketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nInstagram was initially created to display and showcase personal life and photos but with time, these photos and visuals have only become powerful enough to spread the message and motive across due to which business has taken the route of Instagram as well.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt has since then expanded to be a strong contender as the top social media network for brands, businesses, and entrepreneurs like yourself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPortraying the best on this channel helps garner eyeballs, attention and subsequently interest in one&rsquo;s brand or service.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHence, Instagram is a social media tool that will help in expanding one&rsquo;s business and reach across the target audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the platform of Instagram for social business is a strategic as well as an affordable way to grow one&rsquo;s company or brand. With this, one can find new customers, stay connected to the existing ones and connect to potential customers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTapping into the Instagram audience and striking a balance between both artistic and tactical digital marketing strategy, one would surely have a good growth of the Instagram account as well as of business&rsquo; sales.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is a platform that helps one to leverage one&rsquo;s selling point especially when it comes to building and growing small businesses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Hence, the ultimate objective of using Instagram is to strategize posts and stories in order to sell</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, it is significant for a small business or a brand to not only create the most creative and beautiful posts, pictures, visuals, and stories but to plan out strategies that will ultimately get them business and draws a new audience and drives them to their website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.doorsstudio.com/\">By Doors Studio - Digital marketing Agency in India</a></strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>', '1587721138.jpg', '1587721138.jpg', 'New Age Marketing: Promoting Business on INSTAGRAM - Doors Studio', 'Read Doors Studio blog to learn more about New Age Marketing: Promoting Business on INSTAGRAM', 'NEW AGE MARKETING: PROMOTING BUSINESS ON INSTAGRAM', 'active', '2020-01-31 08:47:25', '2020-04-24 04:08:58');

Since it comes up only when a person searches something in same category, it pin points the targeted audience who are, essentially, prospective buyers. Hence, every click becomes meaningful, unlike the click of organic traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the name suggests, the Pay per Click is a paid option for the brands that are willing to pay for the sponsored ads placed at the top of a Google search page. When you choose pay per click option, your advertisement is perceived as more credible and your brand, more reliable. This increases the interest of the customer, and each time one of such advertisements is clicked, the advertiser pays small fees to the search engine, which is little price to pay to have a targeted audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>PPC has many benefits for its users:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Being more reliable, it attracts more people.</li>\r\n	<li>Targeting right people at right time becomes effortless.</li>\r\n	<li>Advertisements can be targeted at global level or a local level, according to the regions, countries, or cities. Users can also set a distance radius for their advertisement.</li>\r\n	<li>Payments are made only for the click, which ensures that the user is paying only for the webpage visits, nothing else.</li>\r\n	<li>Since it costs very less per click, the user can begin with PPC, literally, from any amount.</li>\r\n	<li>The proportion of gaining profits by sale to paying price for ad spot is huge.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an authorized PPC advertising agency, we avail a prospect for our clients to advertise through this paid marketing channel and make their business fly-high with great returns. There are two types of PPC, viz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Flat Rate PPC</strong> in which you pay a fixed sum for each click, and</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Bid Based PPC</strong>, in which bidding is done among the competitors, whoever wins the bid, bags the ad spot; like, for Google advertisers, whoever has highest Google AdRank (CPC Bid multiplied by Quality Score), wins.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both are workable options, according to your business needs and competitors. But bid-based PPC is more dynamic and new, as opposed to old and rigid Flat Rate PPC. Bid-based PPC gives an opportunity to new start-ups to put across their well-formed ads and save a lot of money if they win the spot. The key to win the bid lies with</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>targeting the customer, and</li>\r\n	<li>keyword oriented precisely drafted advertisement</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PPC is highly successful because users find the advertisements for exactly what they are searching for, and it gives an opportunity for advertisers to connect with potential customers at lowest possible prices and generate multifold sales from minimal investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Doors Studio - India &amp; UAE Presence</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a leading PPC advertising Agency in Delhi,India our clientele is spread across India &amp; UAE.
